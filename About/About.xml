  <description>
    Create, record, and listen to music albums in RimWorld. This rebuild converts the original books framework into music:
    Recording Console replaces the Book Printer, Album Rack replaces bookshelves, and pawns record albums and listen to them
    for joy and mood effects. Includes album title and description rule packs, genre hooks, thoughts scaled by quality, and
    a foundation for integrating your broader Rim-Radio content.
